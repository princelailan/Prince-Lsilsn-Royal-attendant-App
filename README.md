# 👑✨ THE ENCHANTED ATTENDANT KINGDOM ✨👑

#### *Ruled by: Prince Lailan & Daltone Tonny – Bringers of Auto-Join Peace*

🏰 Once upon a time, in a world full of boring, awkward silences and late joiners...

A magical spell was cast. From the depths of tired students and chaotic online classes, a tool emerged to **auto-join** Google Meets and Zooms — without embarrassing camera moments or awkward "Can you hear me?" starts.

And that app... was **The Attendant**.

🌟 *Built with tears, jokes, caffeine and a bunny army.*
